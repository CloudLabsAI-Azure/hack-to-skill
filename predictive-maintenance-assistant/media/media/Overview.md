# Build a Predictive Maintenance Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore how to bring intelligence to manufacturing operations by building a **Predictive Maintenance Assistant** using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure Machine Learning. Through this hands-on experience, you’ll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that connects IoT telemetry, predicts equipment failures, and automates maintenance workflows.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered Predictive Maintenance Copilot that helps maintenance engineers and operations teams anticipate failures before they occur. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Machine Learning, and IoT Hub, you’ll build a system that analyzes sensor data, detects anomalies, and recommends corrective actions in real time.

This assistant will act as a virtual maintenance engineer — providing conversational access to equipment health insights, generating alerts for anomalies, and enabling seamless automation through Power Automate and Teams.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Build a maintenance management chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate IoT telemetry from Azure IoT Hub and Event Hub to trigger actions.
- Deploy and connect Azure Machine Learning models for predictive failure detection.
- Implement reasoning and summarization flows using Azure AI Foundry.
- Automate maintenance ticket creation and alerts using Power Automate and Teams.
- Visualize predictive metrics using Power BI dashboards.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format with three progressive stages that mirror a real-world industrial predictive maintenance deployment. Each stage enhances your assistant’s capability from manual data management to full-fledged predictive intelligence.

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** – Deploy a Copilot Studio interface for logging and viewing maintenance tickets and equipment status from Dataverse.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** – Integrate IoT telemetry from Azure IoT Hub and configure Power Automate to trigger maintenance alerts and work orders.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** – Incorporate Azure AI Foundry and Machine Learning models for predictive maintenance insights, anomaly detection, and automated scheduling.

Throughout each challenge, you’ll:
- Analyze real-world maintenance operations challenges.
- Design a scalable, secure, and integrated technical solution.
- Deploy, connect, and validate each component using Azure resources and Power Platform tools.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey starts with building a Copilot Studio interface that allows technicians to record and view maintenance tickets directly in Teams. In the next stage, you’ll connect IoT telemetry streams to trigger alerts when sensor thresholds are exceeded. Finally, you’ll integrate Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning models to predict failures and generate intelligent recommendations.

By the end of this hackathon, you’ll have a fully functional **Predictive Maintenance Copilot** capable of monitoring assets, predicting failures, and automating maintenance workflows across your digital factory ecosystem.
